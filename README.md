## Description:
I added functionality to an existing application by allowing for the user to add expenses and deposits to their budget tracker with or without a connection. When transactions are entered offline, they should populate the total when the user is back online. 

## First Look: 


## Technologies Used: 
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## Installation:
In order to get started on this application, you will first need to ```git clone``` the GitHub repository onto your current working directory. Then, do an ```npm i``` to install all of your node modules. Lastly, create a ```.gitignore``` file for your node modules.
